Description: Core of this package is a heuristic optimization procedure
    (Simulated Annealing) that allows for identifying optimal classification schemes
    for prediction models with continuous response variables. The implemented
    methods were primarily developed to quantify the classification accuracy of
    prediction maps based on statistical models that provide predictions on a
    continuous scale. In many cases, these continuous predictions are afterwards
    discretized into classes for better visualization purposes without considering
    the resulting accuracies of the classification scheme. In a more general
    context, the optimization method can also be used to detect non-constant
    prediction performance of statistical models.
